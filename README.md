# Apple
Recreated the Apple 2015 WWDC logo in pure CSS! And it's better :D

Feel free to do whatever you want with it. I'd appreciate it if you linked back to me (to [GitHub](https://github.com/pmerrity/Apple) or my [portfolio](http://perrymerrity.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=apple), even if it's just in the code comments~). Cheers friends ^_^

* Killed the ugly gradient they were using (I hate gradients)
* Used Roboto + Roboto-Thin for the font (because Roboto)
* Used flatter and more vibrant colors
* Smaller border-radius on the squares
* The two squares in the center are smaller
